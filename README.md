# TIET-Curriculum
I made a curriculum website of my college using HTML and CSS. Got this idea during a talk with my friend, he said it is difficult to find syllabus on google. So, I made a website using tags in HTML like div, img, section etc., and class, in CSS I used universal selector, various properties like display, transform, overflow, background-image etc.
