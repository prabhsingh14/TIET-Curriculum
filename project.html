          Electronic, as well as computer engineers are in great demand in
          industries across the globe. Joint applications such as, mobile
          phones, space shuttles, desktops, tablets, etc are few of the examples
          where competence in both of the fields is of paramount importance. The
          increased use of these technologies in all aspects of our lives
          ensures continued relevance and its expansion in the future. The
          Electronics and Computer Engineering undergraduate program is a course
          which aims to integrate these two separate engineering fields to meet
          the joint demands made by the electronic and computer industries in
          today"s world. This program blends various courses of both fields over
          the period of four years with an emphasis on the design of computing
          systems.
